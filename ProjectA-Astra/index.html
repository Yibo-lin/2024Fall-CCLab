                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Astra is a fish-like creature with a thin, long body. Unlike an eel, it has a fan-shaped tail covered with scales. It has no wings or feet, only two small fins.
                    Though it is said to have colorful scales, it can't be observed during the day. Therefore, it remains a mystery whether it has beautiful scales for human beings to see.

                The origin of its name comes from 'Aquaflora', an ancient myth of an tribe in the Atlantic Ocean islands. It is said that the creature gets this name because it has iridescent scales that shimmers with  blue, navy, and silver, mimicking the ocean's colors. However, there's yet no any photos or videos to prove this appearance.
In Ocean, Astra can do wonderful things in watery environments. Its distinctive scales reflect lights in water and made the water around it glowing with beautiful colors.
Astra is playful and sociable underwater. The water covering its body and scales makes it feel protected and creates current to make Astra move more smoothly in water. 
Astra rests among coral reefs, making disguise using its shiny scales. It feeds on algae, small fish, and aquatic insects.  
It is afraid of jellyfish undersea, for their tectacles release toxic liquid that could burn the scales of Astra.
On Land, due to the unqiue and delicate scales of Astra, it is very sensitive to light and even dust in the air. Astra's special body structure and acoustic detecting abilities makes it feel too much noise and pressure on land. When the water environment is not suitable to live in, it rapidly goes into bushes to make disguise.
